# üëã Hi, I'm Caitlyn Darrach (She/Her)

I'm an emerging data professional with a background in **experimental particle astrophysics** (MSc) with experience working with **research datasets, educational program metrics, and early-stage prototype development**. I enjoy finding useful insights from data, innovating, and continuously improving my technical toolkit through hands-on projects and independent coursework. 

---

### What I'm Working On & Learning
- Building a small collection of **data engineering projects** (Python + pandas/SQL-based workflows)
- Expanding my understanding of **ETL workflows, data validation, and migration processes**
- Developing an early-stage **React prototype** for an educational mobile app concept
- Debugging best practices

### Technical Experience

#### Proficient  (Used repeatedly and independently in research, analysis, or current project work)
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, statsmodels, plotly)  
- **Excel** (cleaning, formulas, KPI tracking, dashboards)  
- **Git / GitHub**  
- **Overleaf / LaTeX** (extensive documentation + scientific formatting)  
- **VS Code**  
- **CLI (zsh, bash)**  

#### Academic Exposure / Foundational Knowledge  (Have worked with them in academic or structured learning settings in the past)
- **C/C++** (research-level data analysis and UI tool programming)  
- **MATLAB** (undergraduate research use)  
- **Java** (introductory OOP coursework)  
- **Linux (Ubuntu environments)**  
- **OriginPro, ROOT** (physics-focused data visualization)  
- **LabVIEW** (instrumentation control/UI workflows)  
- **Mathematica** (symbolic + numerical modeling)  

#### Working Knowledge / Actively Developing  (Used in real contexts or prototyping ‚Äî building comfort)
- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL ‚Äî querying, filtering, joins)  
- **React** (component-based prototyping, UI exploration)  
- **Node.js** (runtime environment for JavaScript-based projects)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (Python-based web scraping)  
- **TensorFlow, PyTorch** (machine learning fundamentals + coursework models)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

---

### I'm motivated by:
- Turning complex data into validated, clear insights for evidence-based decision-making
- Contributing to teams that value **quality, clarity, and long-term impact**
- Learning through experimentation, iteration, and curiosity
- Solving interesting puzzles and problems
- Innovating and creating new devices/processes/etc. that are useful
- Encouraging **STEM education and inquiry-driven learning**
