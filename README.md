# Hi, I'm Caitlyn

I'm an emerging data professional with a background in **experimental particle astrophysics** (MSc) and experience working with **large/messy research datasets, educational program metrics, and early-stage prototype development**. I enjoy finding useful insights from data, innovating, and continuously improving my technical skills through hands-on projects and independent coursework.

### Currently Working On / Learning
- Building a small collection of **data engineering projects** (Python + pandas/SQL-based workflows)
- Expanding understanding of **ETL workflows, data validation, and migration processes**
- Taking introductory SQL courses
- Developing an early-stage **React prototype** for an educational mobile app concept

### Technical Experience

#### Proficient (Used repeatedly and independently in research, analysis, and current project work)
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, statsmodels, plotly)  
- **Excel** (cleaning, formulas, KPI tracking, dashboards)  
- **Git / GitHub**  
- **Overleaf / LaTeX** (documentation + scientific formatting)  
- **VS Code**
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **CLI (zsh, bash)**  

#### Academic Exposure (Have worked with them in academic/work settings in the past)
- **C/C++** (research-level data analysis and UI tool programming)  
- **MATLAB** (undergraduate research use)  
- **Java** (introductory OOP coursework)  
- **Linux (Ubuntu environments)**  
- **OriginPro, ROOT** (physics-focused data visualization)  
- **LabVIEW** (instrumentation control/UI workflows)
- **Mathematica** (numerical modeling)  

#### Basic Knowledge / Actively Developing
- **SQL** (basics - querying, filtering, joins)  
- **React** (component-based prototyping, UI exploration)  
- **Node.js** (runtime environment for JavaScript-based projects)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (Python-based web scraping)  
- **TensorFlow, PyTorch** (machine learning fundamentals + coursework models)

### I'm motivated by:
- Turning complex data into validated, clear insights for evidence-based decision-making
- Learning through experimentation and curiosity
- Solving interesting puzzles and problems
- Innovating and creating new devices/processes/etc. that are useful
- Improving STEM education for underrepresented groups
